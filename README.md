The purpose of this exercise is to learn about machine learning methods to predict the number of purchases of goods by customers of a store. This exercise consists of three phases; In the first phase, we build a first-order Linear Regression model manually without using a ready-made model, then we use the gradient descent method, and in the last phase, we estimate the number of purchases with the help of the Scikit-Learn library.
